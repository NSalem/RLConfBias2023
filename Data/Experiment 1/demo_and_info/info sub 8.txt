strategy: please describe in 1 or a few scentences how you chose symbols.
(strategy might be intuitional: whichever you felt more comfortable with, 
or rational/analytical: keeping track of which symbols led to a win/loss how many times).
I started rational: in the beginning I tried to remember which symbols generated win/loss.
But at some point there were standard combinations so I would have to think about it less, and use my intuition more.
