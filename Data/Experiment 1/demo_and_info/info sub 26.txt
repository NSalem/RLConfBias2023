strategy: please describe in 1 or a few scentences how you chose symbols.
(strategy might be intuitional: whichever you felt more comfortable with, 
or rational/analytical: keeping track of which symbols led to a win/loss how many times). 

In the beginning I was 'testing' the symbols and after that I tried to remember which one won in the previous 'rounds'. For example if a symbol in the previous rounds had given me +0,5 I would choose that, or if one brought -0,5 I would never choose that.
