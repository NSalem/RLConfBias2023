strategy: please describe in 1 or a few scentences how you chose symbols.
(strategy might be intuitional: whichever you felt more comfortable with, 
or rational/analytical: keeping track of which symbols led to a win/loss how many times).  
intuitonal and rational, I was doubting the correctness of my memory with a particular couple of symbols within a set, but tried to keep track of wicht symbols I remembered as winning.
