strategy: please describe in 1 or a few scentences how you chose symbols.
(strategy might be intuitional: whichever you felt more comfortable with, 
or rational/analytical: keeping track of which symbols led to a win/loss how many times).  

try to fix a symbol at first, like always choose the left symbol, and see the feedback. After figure out the rules, like which one seems better, then always choose the symbol in the later terms.
