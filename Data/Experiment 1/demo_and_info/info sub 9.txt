strategy: please describe in 1 or a few scentences how you chose symbols.
(strategy might be intuitional: whichever you felt more comfortable with, 
or rational/analytical: keeping track of which symbols led to a win/loss how many times).  
I tried keeping track of the symbols which were winning and choose them almost every time.
