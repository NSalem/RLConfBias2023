I messed up the sub no.'s so now the practice file for sub 6 is the practice file of sub 5, and sub 5's practice file is lost/overwritten. 
Messed up again but with the test file. because post-test is not possible on it's own, sub 15's test/post-test files are actually sub 16's, and sub 15's files are lost. 

SAVE DATA ON USB AFTER EVERY PARTICIPANT TO PREVENT THIS!
