strategy: please describe in 1 or a few scentences how you chose symbols.
(strategy might be intuitional: whichever you felt more comfortable with, 
or rational/analytical: keeping track of which symbols led to a win/loss how many times).
Mainly keeping track of which symbols led to a win most of the times, in case I wasn't sure I would usually just pick a random symbol or whichever felt more comfortable.
