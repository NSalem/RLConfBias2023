As I was playing the game, I was assigning a postive of negative outcome to each symbol.  As I encounteredd these symbols again and again, I was revelauating the expected outcome that I gave each symbol, based on the new information being given from the feedback, to make my prediction more accurate. For each one, i felt it was either likely to be good, bad or 50/50, though I did not keep a mental tally.
