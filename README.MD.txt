This repository contains code used in [Salem-Garcia et al (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1037/rev0000424).


Contents:
- All code used to simulate choice and confindence (runs from allSimulations.m)
- All code used to fit RL models and confidence regressions (runs from allModelling.m)
- Files containing results of the above (several .mat files in Results folder).
- Code to reproduce the figures in the paper based on the results files (allFigures.m)

Scripts are tested on Matlab 2023a.
Dependencies:
- [VBA-Toolbox](https://mbb-team.github.io/VBA-toolbox/), used for model fitting.
- Matlab Toolboxes: Parallel Computing, Optimization, Statistics and Machine Learning,
